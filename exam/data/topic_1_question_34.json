  "question_text": "Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.<br/><br/>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<br/>You have a Fabric eventstream that loads data into a table named Bike_Location in a KQL database. The table contains the following columns:<br/><br/>BikepointID -<br/><br/>Street -<br/><br/>Neighbourhood -<br/><br/>No_Bikes -<br/><br/>No_Empty_Docks -<br/><br/>Timestamp -<br/>You need to apply transformation and filter logic to prepare the data for consumption. The solution must return data for a neighbourhood named Sands End when No_Bikes is at least 15. The results must be ordered by No_Bikes in ascending order.<br/><br/>Solution: You use the following code segment:<br/><img src=\"images/dp-700_topic-1_question-34_html_1.png\" title=\"image28\"/><br/><br/>Does this meet the goal?",

  "discussion": "no, order by by default is desc in kql\n\ndefault is desc in Kusto\n\nDuplicate of previous question\n\nB is correct\n\nB-No, in KQL by default “order by” is desc order\n\nCorrect Answer: B. No\n🔍 Explanation:\nThe code is almost identical to the previous correct example, but this time it uses order by instead of sort by, and that’s the issue.\n\nThey are asking for the order of No_Bikes in ascending order in this question\n\nThe default sorting order in KQL is **descending (desc)**; **ascending (asc) must be explicitly specified when needed.**\n\nno. In kql desc is default for sort/order  by:\n\n\"asc sorts into ascending order, low to high. Default is desc, high to low.\"\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/sort-operator?view=microsoft-fabric\n\ndefault is desc\n\nno. In kql desc is default for sort by:\n\n\"asc sorts into ascending order, low to high. Default is desc, high to low.\"\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/sort-operator?view=microsoft-fabric\n\n\"The sort and order operators are equivalent\"\n\nThe provided solution meets the goal.\n\nAnalysis:\nFiltering Condition:\n\nThe code includes filter Neighbourhood == \"Sands End\" and No_Bikes >= 15, which satisfies the requirement to only include rows where the neighborhood is \"Sands End\" and No_Bikes is at least 15.\nOrdering:\n\nThe order by No_Bikes clause ensures that the results are sorted by No_Bikes in ascending order, meeting the stated requirement.\nProjection:\n\nThe project BikepointID, Street, Neighbourhood, No_Bikes, No_Empty_Docks, Timestamp ensures that the necessary columns are returned.\nConclusion:\nThe solution fulfills all the requirements.\nCorrect Answer: A. Yes.\n\nthe answer is yes since you don't have to specify the \"asc\" option.  It is the default.\n\nThe answer is no. The default for order by in KQL in desc therefore asc must be specified. Confusing at first as it is the opposite of SQL.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/kusto/query/sort-operator?view=azure-data-explorer#parameters",
