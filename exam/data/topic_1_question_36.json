Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.<br/><br/>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<br/>You have a Fabric eventstream that loads data into a table named Bike_Location in a KQL database. The table contains the following columns:<br/><br/>BikepointID -<br/><br/>Street -<br/><br/>Neighbourhood -<br/><br/>No_Bikes -<br/><br/>No_Empty_Docks -<br/><br/>Timestamp -<br/><br/>You need to apply transformation and filter logic to prepare the data for consumption. The solution must return data for a neighbourhood named Sands End when No_Bikes is at least 15. The results must be ordered by No_Bikes in ascending order.<br/><br/>Solution: You use the following code segment:<br/><img src=\"images/dp-700_topic-1_question-36_html_1.png\" title=\"image31\"/><br/><br/>Does this meet the goal?",

  "discussion": "SQL By default shows ASC order\n\nYou need to use \"--\" to tell the KQL DB to read code as SQL.\nOtherwise it tries to read it as KQL\n\nJust run a SQL query in KQL database without any indication that is SQL so without using \"\" or -- anything likr that and it run just fine. Also I confirmed that ASC is the default\n\nNow you don't need. The code works properly in Fabric\n\nQuery should not be Case Sensitive ??\n\nNeed to add \"--\" on the begining\n\nYou can use SQL code directly without any additional \"--\" now (checked in Fabric). Also, it is case insensitive to the column and table names, order by sorts ascending by default. So, everything is correct.\n\nA Because the -- is not required for T-SQL in Fabric.\n\nGeneral syntax is correct but there are typo in neighbourhood and no_bikes\n\nI tried it in Fabric and it works.\nOrder By is ascending order by default in SQL. (It is desc order in KQL)\nNo need to use \"--\" in the Eventhouse.\nAlso it is case insensitive so even if Neighbourhood is the column, WHERE neihborhood >=15 works\n\nA , is SQL\n\nMissing- - characters\n\nThe query it is right, but I believe it a tricky question. The solution is not correct just for the fact that is a SQL query I believe the solution must be a KQL query\n\nIt is not clear but the question states that the table is in a KQL database, so the query targets a KQL DB. Since the syntax is T-SQL, it must be prefixed with -- to work correctly.\n\nSQL By default shows ASC order\n\nYES, this is SQL and order by is asc by default\n\nSQL is by-default in asc order while using order by\n\nyou have to add \"--\" in the beginning\n\nMost Probably is A \nthe -- is not universally required for T-SQL in Fabric. \nIt’s only required when you’re:  Mixing T-SQL inside a KQL context",
