Litware also manages an online advertising business for the authors it represents.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Fabric Environment<br/><br/>Litware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.<br/><br/>The company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Data Processing<br/><br/>The retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.<br/><br/>Litware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.<br/><br/>Litware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Sales Data<br/><br/>Month-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.<br/><br/>In the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.<br/><br/>The sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:<br/><br/>•\tSales Date<br/>•\tAuthor<br/>•\tPrice<br/>•\tUnits<br/>•\tSKU<br/><br/>A table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Security Groups<br/><br/>Litware has the following security groups:<br/><br/>•\tSales<br/>•\tFabric Admins<br/>•\tStreaming Admins<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Performance Issues<br/><br/>Business users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for two hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the reports fail to load: “The SQL query failed while running.”<br/><br/>The data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.<br/><br/>When the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.<br/><br/>The company’s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Planned Changes<br/> -<br/><br/>Litware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.<br/><br/>Litware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Version Control<br/> -<br/><br/>Litware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.<br/><br/>Requirements. Governance Requirements<br/><br/>To control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.<br/><br/>Requirements. Data Requirements<br/><br/>Litware identifies the following data requirements:<br/><br/>•\tProcess the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).<br/>•\tMake the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.<br/>•\tWhen a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.<br/><br/><br/>You need to ensure that the authors can see only their respective sales data.<br/><br/>How should you complete the statement? To answer, drag the appropriate values the correct targets. Each value may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.<br/><br/>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br/><br/><img src=\"images/dp-700_topic-1_question-38_html_1.png\"/>",
