Litware also manages an online advertising business for the authors it represents.<br/>Existing Environment. Fabric Environment<br/>Litware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.<br/>The company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.<br/>Existing Environment. Data Processing<br/>The retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.<br/>Litware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.<br/>Litware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.<br/>Existing Environment. Sales Data<br/>Month-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.<br/>In the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.<br/>The sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:<br/><br/>Sales Date -<br/><br/>Author -<br/><br/>Price -<br/><br/>Units -<br/><br/>SKU -<br/>A table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.<br/>Existing Environment. Security Groups<br/>Litware has the following security groups:<br/><br/>Sales -<br/><br/>Fabric Admins -<br/><br/>Streaming Admins -<br/>Existing Environment. Performance Issues<br/>Business users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for two hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the reports fail to load: “The SQL query failed while running.”<br/>The data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.<br/>When the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.<br/>The company’s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.<br/><br/>Requirements. Planned Changes -<br/>Litware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.<br/>Litware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.<br/><br/>Requirements. Version Control -<br/>Litware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.<br/>Requirements. Governance Requirements<br/>To control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.<br/><br/>Requirements. Data Requirements -<br/>Litware identifies the following data requirements:<br/>Process the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).<br/>Make the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.<br/>When a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.<br/>You need to resolve the sales data issue. The solution must minimize the amount of data transferred.<br/>What should you do?",

  "discussion": "With dataflows, you can bring large amounts of data into PowerBI or your organizational’s provided storage. \nIn some cases, however, it’s not practical to update a full copy of source data in each refresh. A good alternative is incremental refresh, which provides the following benefits for dataflows : \nRefresh occurs faster: Only data that’s changed needs to be refreshed\nRefresh is more reliable: It’s not necessary to maintain long-running connections to volatile source systems\nResource consumption is reduced: less data to refresh reduces overall consumption of memory and other resources\n\nE. Configure incremental refresh for the dataflow. Set Refresh rows from the past to 1 Month.\nWhy:\nSource data older than one month never changes.\nUsing incremental refresh ensures the dataflow only pulls changed/new rows instead of reprocessing the entire history each run — which minimizes data transferred.\nSetting \"Refresh rows from the past\" = 1 Month means each refresh run only fetches the last month of data (the only range that can change), so morning data will be up-to-date while unnecessary data transfer for older unchanged rows is avoided. Reference ChatGPT\n\nE: Incremental refresh ensures that only new or changed data is processed during each refresh, rather than reloading the entire dataset.\nA. it doesn’t directly address the issue of reducing data transfer or refreshing only recent data.\nB. controls when the data is refreshed, but not how much data is refreshed. It doesn’t reduce the volume of data processed.\nC. controls how much data is stored, not how much is refreshed. \nD. This would refresh too much data unnecessarily, increasing load and defeating the goal of minimizing data transfer.\n\nDataflow Gen1 is being used and data that is older than one month never changes.\n\nCan you elaborate on that?",
