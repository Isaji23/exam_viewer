  "discussion": "For high-throughput, event-triggered ingestion of large files into a lakehouse without transformations, Data pipeline is the most appropriate and efficient item in Fabric.\n\nI just took the exam. The options to choose from are different now:\nEventstream.\nDataflow\nActivator\nNotebook\n\nWich one do you guess is correct?\n\nEventstream.\n\nstreaming event - Eventstream\nlarge file - DataFlow , I guess\n\nis the same previous question\n\nsame as the previous question\n\nData Pipeline is not right as at 2025-Jan as the storage trigger is still in preview, so it doesn't satisfy the requirement. But it's probably the best option.",
