Litware also manages an online advertising business for the authors it represents.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Fabric Environment<br/><br/>Litware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.<br/><br/>The company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Data Processing<br/><br/>The retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.<br/><br/>Litware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.<br/><br/>Litware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Sales Data<br/><br/>Month-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.<br/><br/>In the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.<br/><br/>The sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:<br/><br/>•\tSales Date<br/>•\tAuthor<br/>•\tPrice<br/>•\tUnits<br/>•\tSKU<br/><br/>A table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Security Groups<br/><br/>Litware has the following security groups:<br/><br/>•\tSales<br/>•\tFabric Admins<br/>•\tStreaming Admins<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Performance Issues<br/><br/>Business users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for two hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the reports fail to load: “The SQL query failed while running.”<br/><br/>The data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.<br/><br/>When the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.<br/><br/>The company’s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Planned Changes -<br/><br/>Litware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.<br/><br/>Litware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Version Control -<br/><br/>Litware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.<br/><br/>Requirements. Governance Requirements<br/><br/>To control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Data Requirements -<br/><br/>Litware identifies the following data requirements:<br/><br/>•\tProcess the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).<br/>•\tMake the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.<br/>•\tWhen a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.<br/><br/><br/>What should you recommend that the data engineering team use to ingest the SEO data?",

  "discussion": "Eventstream in Microsoft Fabric is designed to ingest streaming data from various sources, including REST APIs via custom connectors or intermediaries like Azure Event Hubs or Power Platform\n\nC. Notebook that uses Apache Spark Structured Streaming\n\nCould technically handle streaming REST API data, but:\n\nRequires custom code and continuous compute (not cost-effective).\n\nViolates the governance requirement:\n\n“Use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.”\n\nNotebooks are for transformation, not optimal ingestion for streaming REST APIs.\n⚠️ Possible, but not best practice here.\n\nD. Eventstream\n\nPurpose-built Fabric item for real-time data ingestion and processing.\n\nCan connect to REST APIs, Kafka, or Event Hubs as a source, and route data to:\n\nLakehouses,\n\nWarehouses,\n\nReal-time dashboards.\n\nProvides NRT (near real-time) streaming capability with no extra Azure services.\n✅ Perfect match to requirements.\n\nIf you want to ingest REST API data into Eventstream, you need a bridge : Write a producer app / notebook / pipeline that polls the REST API and pushes the responses into Eventstream.\nIn Fabric, Notebook Structured Stream just means Apache Spark Structured Streaming running inside a Fabric (Spark) notebook.\nIt is A mechanism/engine in Spark (not one single function) that treats streaming data as an unbounded table.\nYou use the DataFrame/Dataset API with two entry points:\nspark.readStream... → defines a streaming source\ndf.writeStream... → defines a streaming sink and starts the query\nFor this question, the code is df.writeStream\n\nA notebook that uses Apache Spark Structured Streaming can poll a REST endpoint, consume webhooks (via Reflex), or accept pushed events and handle retries/backpressure, parsing, enrichment, and windowing in one place.\n\nideal if the API can push events into Event Hubs/Eventhouse; if the API cannot push, you’d still need a polling/worker (not Eventstream alone). If the provider can push to an event endpoint, Eventstream becomes a good alternative\n\nIf the question says “data from a REST API in near-real-time, using only Fabric,” the most correct answer is:\n\nEventstream (D), but you need that intermediate component outside of Fabric (even if it’s very small).\n\nIf the exam does not allow external resources (no Functions, Logic Apps, or Event Hubs outside Fabric), then there is currently no 100% native solution for streaming data from REST APIs in Fabric\n\nI feel it should be the notebook, as its mentioned that data engineers are quite comfortable in python\n\nsorry i meant C\n\nNobody here? Is the given answer correct?",
