Litware also manages an online advertising business for the authors it represents.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Fabric Environment<br/><br/>Litware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.<br/><br/>The company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Data Processing<br/><br/>The retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.<br/><br/>Litware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP system as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and silver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.<br/><br/>Litware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Sales Data<br/><br/>Month-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.<br/><br/>In the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.<br/><br/>The sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the following fields of the source:<br/><br/>•\tSales Date<br/>•\tAuthor<br/>•\tPrice<br/>•\tUnits<br/>•\tSKU<br/><br/>A table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors authenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Security Groups<br/><br/>Litware has the following security groups:<br/><br/>•\tSales<br/>•\tFabric Admins<br/>•\tStreaming Admins<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Performance Issues<br/><br/>Business users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for two hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the reports fail to load: “The SQL query failed while running.”<br/><br/>The data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.<br/><br/>When the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.<br/><br/>The company’s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Planned Changes -<br/><br/>Litware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.<br/><br/>Litware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Version Control -<br/><br/>Litware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.<br/><br/>Requirements. Governance Requirements<br/><br/>To control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Data Requirements -<br/><br/>Litware identifies the following data requirements:<br/><br/>•\tProcess the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).<br/>•\tMake the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.<br/>•\tWhen a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.<br/><br/><br/>You need to ensure that processes for the bronze and silver layers run in isolation.<br/><br/>How should you configure the Apache Spark settings?",

  "discussion": "In Microsoft Fabric, when you want to isolate different workloads, such as data processing jobs for different medallion layers (bronze, silver, gold), the best practice is to use custom Spark pools. This allows:\n\nIsolation of resources: Ensuring the bronze and silver layers don’t interfere with each other in terms of compute or memory.\n\nDedicated execution environments: Each pool can be optimized/configured differently based on the workload characteristics.\n\nBetter performance and reliability: Avoid contention in high-load scenarios like month-end processing or spikes during new book releases.\n\nAnswer is B.\nA would make things worse.\nC improves the performance, but would not isolate\nD has nothing about performance or isolation\n\nB- Creating a custom Apache Spark pool allows you to isolate workloads such as the bronze and silver layer processes. This ensures dedicated resources for each process, improves performance, and prevents contention between workloads.\n\nB is correct\n\nThe requirement is to run notebook sessions for Bronze and Silver in isolation -> disable high concurrency:\nHigh concurrency mode allows users to share the same Spark sessions in Apache Spark for Fabric data engineering and data science workloads. An item like a notebook uses a Spark session for its execution and when enabled allows users to share a single Spark session across multiple notebooks.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/workspace-admin-settings#high-concurrency\n\nI think it is (B), custom pools:\nWhy Not the Other Options?\nA. Disable high concurrency:\nNot suitable here. High concurrency mode allows multiple lightweight queries to run simultaneously. Disabling it doesn't help with workload isolation and might reduce performance for concurrent jobs.\n\nC. Modify the number of executors:\nThis affects how Spark parallelizes tasks within a single job but doesn’t isolate workloads or prevent resource contention between different jobs.\n\nD. Set the default environment:\nThis option just sets where notebooks run by default. It doesn't provide isolation between different layers.",
