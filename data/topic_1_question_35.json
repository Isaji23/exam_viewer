  "question_text": "Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.<br/><br/>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<br/>You have a Fabric eventstream that loads data into a table named Bike_Location in a KQL database. The table contains the following columns:<br/><br/>BikepointID -<br/><br/>Street -<br/><br/>Neighbourhood -<br/><br/>No_Bikes -<br/><br/>No_Empty_Docks -<br/><br/>Timestamp -<br/>You need to apply transformation and filter logic to prepare the data for consumption. The solution must return data for a neighbourhood named Sands End when No_Bikes is at least 15. The results must be ordered by No_Bikes in ascending order.<br/><br/>Solution: You use the following code segment:<br/><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/dp-700/image28.png\" title=\"image30\"/><br/><br/>Does this meet the goal?",

  "discussion": "The sort and order operators are equivalent. \n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/sort-operator?view=microsoft-fabric\n\nin KQL, both table and column names are case sensitive. Hence, the table name doesn't match with description.  Hence, this query will fail.\nNO issues with filter as both \"where\" and \"filter\" keywords work in KQL.\n\nwhy we are not Considering Table Name \n**Table name is incorrect. It is case-sensitive.\nIn the scenario the table is named Bike_Location.\nThe query uses bike_location (all lowercase).\n\nIn KQL, identifiers (table/column names) are case-sensitive. Using the wrong case for the table name will cause the query to fail to resolve the table, even though the rest of the query logic is correct:\n\n'filter' is wrong, instead 'where' is correct, so I think the answer is 'B'\n\nTable name is incorrect. It is case-sensitive.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/schema-entities/entity-names?view=azure-data-explorer&preserve-view=true#reference-identifiers-in-queries\n\nDon't you think answer is \"No\" , as the query should use \"where\" instead of \"filter\"?\n\nA is correct\n\nA (Adding ASC after ORDER BY no_bikes explicitly enforces ascending order)\n\n\"Identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, you can't refer to a table called ThisTable as thisTABLE.\" I wonder how many times I have to add a comment before it is shown in the discussion. \nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/schema-entities/entity-names?view=azure-data-explorer&preserve-view=true#reference-identifiers-in-queries\n\nDon't you think answer is \"No\" , as the query should use \"where\" instead of \"filter\"\n\nThe where and filter operators are equivalent\n\ncorrect!\n\nsort by and order by are synonyms\n\nActually, the correct answer is No here because 'sort by' is illegal in KQL.  It should be 'order by' instead.\n\n\"sort by\" is legal in KQL, it is the same as \"order by\"\n\nno, sort by and order by both work and are equal\n\nA is correct.",
