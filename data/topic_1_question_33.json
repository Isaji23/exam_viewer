  "question_text": "Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.<br/><br/>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<br/>You have a Fabric eventstream that loads data into a table named Bike_Location in a KQL database. The table contains the following columns:<br/><br/>BikepointID -<br/><br/>Street -<br/><br/>Neighbourhood -<br/><br/>No_Bikes -<br/><br/>No_Empty_Docks -<br/><br/>Timestamp -<br/><br/>You need to apply transformation and filter logic to prepare the data for consumption. The solution must return data for a neighbourhood named Sands End when No_Bikes is at least 15. The results must be ordered by No_Bikes in ascending order.<br/><br/>Solution: You use the following code segment:<br/><img src=\"https://img.examtopics.com/dp-700/image25.png\" title=\"image26\"/><br/><br/>Does this meet the goal?",

  "discussion": "The answer is B. No because the \"sort by\" is sorting values in descending order (default behavior --> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/sort-operator?view=microsoft-fabric). One should add \"asc\" to sort values as required. The double \"project\" at the end does not affect the final result\n\nsort is desc by default in kql\n\nB. Default KQL sorting is descending\n\nB is correct\n\nB-No, in KQL by default “sort by” is desc order\n\nsort in kql by default is descending\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/?view=microsoft-fabric\nKusto is case sensitive on almost anything. The table being referenced is not capitalized like the name. Could be a typo in the test or an attention to detail question.\n\nsort by in kql is by default in descending order\n\nIn KQL the where keyword should be used instead of filter.\n\nApologies, I have now learned the where and filter operators are equivalent in KQL. So the answer is correct depending on whether the duplicated project is a mistake in the question.\n\nAlso consider that the default for order by/sort by in KQL is is desc (high to low). The opposite of SQL.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/kusto/query/sort-operator?view=azure-data-explorer#parameters\n\nThe duplicated project, even though not required, does however work and does not throw any errors.\n\nThe provided code segment meets the goal.\n\nBreakdown:\nFilter Condition:\nThe code uses filter Neighbourhood == \"Sands End\" and No_Bikes >= 15 to meet the requirement of filtering the data for the \"Sands End\" neighborhood and where No_Bikes is at least 15.\n\nSorting:\nThe sort by No_Bikes clause ensures that the results are ordered by No_Bikes in ascending order, which aligns with the requirement.\n\nProjection:\nThe fields BikepointID, Street, Neighbourhood, No_Bikes, No_Empty_Docks, and Timestamp are projected, which ensures the required fields are returned for the query.\n\nHence, the solution is correct and achieves the stated goal. The correct answer is A. Yes.",
