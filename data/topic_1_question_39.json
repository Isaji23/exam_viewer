As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<br/><br/>You have an Azure key vault named KeyVault1 that contains secrets.<br/><br/>You have a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. Workspace contains a notebook named Notebook1 that performs the following tasks:<br/><br/>•\tLoads stage data to the target tables in a lakehouse<br/>•\tTriggers the refresh of a semantic model<br/><br/>You plan to add functionality to Notebook1 that will use the Fabric API to monitor the semantic model refreshes.<br/><br/>You need to retrieve the registered application ID and secret from KeyVault1 to generate the authentication token.<br/><br/>Solution: You use the following code segment:<br/><br/>Use notebookutils.credentials.getSecret and specify the key vault URL and key vault secret.<br/><br/>Does this meet the goal?",

  "discussion": "According to the documentation, the name of the secret is simply called secret. So I think that's correct.\n\nHelp on module notebookutils.credentials in notebookutils:\n\nNAME\n    notebookutils.credentials - Utility for credentials operations in Fabric\n\nFUNCTIONS\n    getSecret(akvName, secret) -> str\n        Gets a secret from the given Azure Key Vault.\n        :param akvName: The name of the Azure Key Vault.\n        :param secret: The name of the secret.\n        :return: The secret value.\n\nNo.\nnotebookutils.credentials.getSecret(\"https://<vault-name>.vault.azure.net/\", \"mySecretName\")\nURL works\nSecret name should be provided instead of secret itself (why do you need a kv, if you show the secret in your code?)\n\nAnswer: B\nThe use cased mentioned “and specify the key vault URL and key vault SECRET”. \nNOT secret name.\nKey vault secret is different from secret name\n\nReference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/notebook-utilities#get-secret\nnotebookutils.credentials.getSecret('https://<name>.vault.azure.net/', 'secret name')\n\nA - No doubts\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/notebook-utilities#get-secret\n\nB.\nBy your link, the secret NAME is required, not secret itself\n\nLeaving aside that we do not know with whom the secret is shared in the Key Vault and that this approach is not best practice, with matching Key Vault setup it would work.\n\nA- Yes\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/notebook-utilities#get-secret-using-user-credentials\n\nGet secret using user credentials:\nnotebookutils.credentials.getSecret('https://<name>.vault.azure.net/', 'secret name')\n\nYou do not specify the Key Vault URL. You do specify the Linked Service Name that represents the Key Vault (as configured in Microsoft Fabric). Then you specify the Secret Name within that Key Vault.\n\nYou can use Key Vault references which is still in preview and then it would work, but otherwise you specify a link to a key vault as shown there\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/notebook-utilities#get-secret\n\nAnswer should be Yes. We normally use Key Vault name and linked service, but we still can use Key Vault URL.\nnotebookutils.credentials.getSecret('https://<name>.vault.azure.net/', 'secret name')\n\nref link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/notebook-utilities",
