Company Overview -<br/>Contoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics.<br/><br/>Overview. IT Structure -<br/>The company’s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems.<br/>The data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data.<br/>The data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Fabric -<br/>Contoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items.<br/>Contoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode.<br/>Existing Environment. Source Systems<br/>Contoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales transactions that were processed on the company’s website.<br/>The company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint.<br/>Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions.<br/>Existing Environment. Product Data<br/>POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables:<br/><br/>Products -<br/><br/>ProductCategories -<br/><br/>ProductSubcategories -<br/>In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Azure -<br/>Contoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups:<br/>DataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts<br/>DataEngineers: Contains the data engineers<br/>Contoso has an Azure subscription.<br/>The company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric.<br/>Existing Environment. User Problems<br/>The VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric.<br/>The data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail.<br/><br/>Requirements. Planned Changes -<br/>Contoso plans to create the following two lakehouses:<br/>Lakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources<br/>Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries<br/>Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation.<br/>Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric.<br/>Requirements. Technical Requirements<br/>The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization.<br/>Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers.<br/>Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible.<br/>The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements:<br/>Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access.<br/>Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses.<br/>Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements:<br/>The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items.<br/>Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format.<br/>No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer.<br/>Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data.<br/>In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again.<br/>Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB.<br/>Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed.<br/>Requirements. Data Transformation<br/>In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1.<br/>Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer.<br/><br/>Requirements. Data Security -<br/>Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements:<br/>The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files.<br/>The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer.<br/>The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers.<br/>The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA.<br/>You need to ensure that usage of the data in the Amazon S3 bucket meets the technical requirements.<br/>What should you do?",

  "discussion": "Enabling caching for the workspace will help minimize egress costs by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred across clouds. Creating a shortcut ensures that the raw data is not duplicated in the lakehouse.\n\nNOT \"D\": Create a shortcut and ensure that caching is enabled for the workspace.\nEnabling caching would store temporary copies of the data in Fabric, which contradicts the requirement to prevent storing raw data in the lakehouses.\n\nFinal Answer:\n✅ B. Create a shortcut and ensure that caching is disabled for the workspace.\n\nthe requirement was to prevent storing data in the Lakehouse, not Fabric\n\nHow Fabric handles this\nShortcut (no cache):\nData is always read directly from S3.\n✅ No copy of the raw data is made in the lakehouse.\n❌ But each query re-reads from S3 → high egress costs.\n\nShortcut with cache enabled:\nFirst time you read, Fabric fetches from S3 and stores it in a temporary Fabric-managed cache (not in your lakehouse bronze/silver/gold folders).\n✅ Avoids repeatedly pulling the same bytes across clouds → minimizes egress costs.\n✅ Still no “copy” of the raw dataset inside your lakehouse — the raw data in S3 remains the source of truth.\n\nD is correct\n\nThis is a stupid question, because how could you prevent data to be stored, but they want to minimize the egress costs of transfering data? It goes in the wrong hand. But, to give them an answer for this, IS B.\n\n✅ B. Create a shortcut and ensure that caching is disabled for the workspace.\n❌ D. Create a shortcut and ensure that caching is enabled for the workspace: Caching would create a copy of the data within the Fabric workspace, violating the requirement to \"Prevent saving a copy of the raw data.\" Therefore, while creating a shortcut is correct, enabling caching would be the wrong action.\n\nCreate a shortcut so that data isn't saved to the lakehouse.\nCaching will minimize egress costs. If caching is disabled we always need to look at the source all the time and that increases egress cost. Caching isnt technically saving data to the lakehouse.\n\nCreate a shortcut so that data isn't saved to the lakehouse. \nCaching will minimize egress costs. If caching is disabled we always need to look at the source all the time and that increases egress cost. Caching isnt technically saving data to the lakehouse.\n\nthis shoud be D\n\nThe use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements:\nMinimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access. - This is solved by creating a shortcut\nPrevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses. - This is solved by removing caching and the shortcut needs to look at the source all the time\n\nI correct myself. caching isnt technically saving data to the lakehouse.\ncaching will minimize egress costs given that if caching is disabled we always need to look at the source all the time.\n\nB. Create a shortcut and ensure that caching is disabled for the workspace.\n\nI am a little confused by some of the responses that literally say the Answer is D, then say (because we do not want to Cache it)... D is caching it, \n\nMy reason is this.\nWhile we must watch our Egress costs, that is a measurable thing, whether we are or aren't, however, when you say NO raw data to be stored, that's not a relative question or expectation its a statement of expectation which isn't relative.\n\nSo B.\n\nB: Reduce eegress costs.\n\nPara garantir controle de acesso seguro e refinado a dados armazenados em um bucket do Amazon S3 dentro do Microsoft Fabric, precisa \"Criar uma Identidade de Espaço de Trabalho\" \nEssa identidade é usada para autenticar e acessar recursos externos como Amazon S3 de forma centralizada e segura.\nDepois, você usa essa identidade:\nPara configurar pipelines de dados que movimentam e transformam dados entre camadas (bronze → prata → ouro)\n\nPara aplicar regras de governança por camada\nPara aplicar segurança em nível de dado ou objeto\n\nd: caching to minimize call the source so reduce net consume\n\nCaching would store data in Fabric, violating the \"no raw data copies\" rule\n\nenable caching violates no-copy rule from the case study, and it takes higher priority compared to minimize the costs,\n\nCorrect is D",
