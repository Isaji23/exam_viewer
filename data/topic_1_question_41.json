Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.<br/><br/>After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen.<br/><br/>You have an Azure key vault named KeyVault1 that contains secrets.<br/><br/>You have a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. Workspace contains a notebook named Notebook1 that performs the following tasks:<br/><br/>•\tLoads stage data to the target tables in a lakehouse<br/>•\tTriggers the refresh of a semantic model<br/><br/>You plan to add functionality to Notebook1 that will use the Fabric API to monitor the semantic model refreshes.<br/><br/>You need to retrieve the registered application ID and secret from KeyVault1 to generate the authentication token.<br/><br/>Solution: You use the following code segment:<br/><br/>Use notebookutils.credentials.getSecret and specify the key vault URL and the name of a linked service.<br/><br/>Does this meet the goal?",

  "discussion": "B\nsecret name is needed instead of linked service\n\nCorrect answer is B\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/microsoft-spark-utilities?pivots=programming-language-python is mssparkutils \n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/notebook-utilities#get-secret-using-user-credentials is NotebookUtils (former MSSparkUtils) for Fabric\n\nGet secret\ngetSecret returns an Azure Key Vault secret for a given Azure Key Vault endpoint and secret name using user credentials.\nnotebookutils.credentials.getSecret('https://<name>.vault.azure.net/', 'secret name')\n\nB -  No (You can use either the Key Vault URL or the Linked Service name, but not both at the same time)\n\nIt's B without the name of the secret\n\nNo, this solution does not meet the goal. The notebookutils.credentials.getSecret method requires the key vault URL and the name of the secret, not the name of a linked service.\n\nI don't believe the proposed solution works as all forms of getSecret() requires 'secret name', even with 'linked service name' specified: \nmssparkutils.credentials.getSecret('azure key vault name','secret name','linked service name')\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/microsoft-spark-utilities?pivots=programming-language-python\n\nIn my understating (A) is the correct answer:\n\nnotebookutils.credentials.getSecret(\"<KeyVault URL>\", \"<Linked Service Name>\")\n\nis used to retrieve secrets (such as client IDs and secrets) from Azure Key Vault using a linked service.\n\nI believe KY URL and Secret are always required params, while LinkedServiceName is optional\n\nNo, you need put secret name as second value if you use Key Vault URL method, you need put Azure Key Vault name if you want to use linked service.\nnotebookutils.credentials.getSecret('https://<name>.vault.azure.net/', 'secret name')",
