Company Overview -<br/><br/>Contoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics.<br/><br/><br/>Overview. IT Structure -<br/><br/>The company’s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems.<br/><br/>The data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data.<br/><br/>The data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL.<br/><br/><br/>Existing Environment. Fabric -<br/><br/>Contoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items.<br/>Contoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Source Systems<br/><br/>Contoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales transactions that were processed on the company’s website.<br/><br/>The company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint.<br/><br/>Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Product Data<br/><br/>POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables:<br/><br/>Products -<br/><br/>ProductCategories -<br/><br/>ProductSubcategories -<br/>In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories.<br/><br/>Existing Environment. Azure -<br/>Contoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups:<br/>DataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts<br/>DataEngineers: Contains the data engineers<br/><br/>Contoso has an Azure subscription.<br/><br/>The company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric.<br/>Existing Environment. User Problems<br/>The VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric.<br/><br/>The data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Planned Changes -<br/><br/>Contoso plans to create the following two lakehouses:<br/>Lakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources<br/>Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries<br/>Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation.<br/>Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric.<br/><br/>Requirements. Technical Requirements<br/><br/>The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization.<br/><br/>Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers.<br/><br/>Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible.<br/>The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements:<br/>Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access.<br/>Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses.<br/><br/>Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements:<br/>The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items.<br/>Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format.<br/><br/>No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer.<br/><br/>Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data.<br/><br/>In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again.<br/><br/>Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB.<br/>Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed.<br/><br/>Requirements. Data Transformation<br/><br/>In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1.<br/><br/>Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer.<br/><br/><br/>Requirements. Data Security -<br/><br/>Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements:<br/>The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files.<br/><br/>The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer.<br/><br/>The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers.<br/><br/>The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA.<br/><br/>You need to ensure that the data analysts can access the gold layer lakehouse.<br/><br/>What should you do?",

  "discussion": "By granting Read all SQL Endpoint data permission, the analysts get the necessary and sufficient access to query the gold layer data while adhering to the principle of least privilege.\n\nHi QAZdbarhate12345678 I have 2 questions please\n1. Which lakehouse is Answer C referring to: Lakehouse1 or Lakehouse2?\n2. The case study overview says \"The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers.\" If we share the lakehouse with the DataAnalysts group will this not give the data analysts access to the data in the bronze and silver layers? \n\nThank you\n\nAnswering much time after, but it refer to Lakehouse2 or lakehouse3. The Lakehouse will be the Lakehouse with the gold layer.\n\nSemantic model access is too limited. Requirement specifies the upstream Gold Layer Delta Tables (i.e. in the Lakehouse) thanks https://ln.run/rD6kx\n\nThe data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer.\n\nOption C is the best choice among given options. Though Option A is also correct as all the 3 options of Item level control is valid only when users are viewers (and not admin,  members or contributors), but only Option A is not sufficient. When a role is defined as a viewer, it automatically gets the \"Read all SQL endpoint data\" access as the readonly access to all the lakehouse data using SQL endpoints only. \"Read all Apache Spark\" provides access to the underlying files also and not only the Gold layer datawarehouse tables. \"Build reports on the default semantic model\" provides access to semantic model for building power bi reports which is not the requirement in this case. Since the Bronze and Silver layer is in Lakehouse 1 and the Gold Layer is in Lakehouse 2 as a Datawarehouse, the Data Analyst role will be provided to Lakehouse 2 only.\n\nData Analysts group don't need access to Workspace A since they do not have any business with Bronze and Silver layers. The Gold layer is in Workspace B, but since that is not the only item in the workspace, giving them workspace view access is does not obey the least privilege's rule. So, they only need to access Lakehouse 2 and granting the Read all SQL Endpoint data permission is the answer to that.\n\nThis question centers on controlled access to data layers in Fabric, specifically:\n\nData analysts must access only the gold layer in the lakehouse.\n\nThey must not access bronze or silver layers.\n\nThey need to read data in the gold layer (i.e., for analytics).\n\nSQL-based access is the right fit for data analysts (T-SQL and Power BI reports).\n\nThe gold layer is typically exposed through the SQL analytics endpoint of the lakehouse.\n\nO acesso ao modelo semântico é muito limitado. O requisito especifica as Tabelas Delta da Camada Dourada upstream (ou seja, no Lakehouse).\n\nwe share the gold layer lakehouse\n\nThank you\n\nSemantic model access is too limited. Requirement specifies the upstream Gold Layer Delta Tables (i.e. in the Lakehouse)\n\nSharing the lakehouse with the DataAnalysts group and granting the Read all SQL Endpoint data permission would allow them to query the Delta tables in the gold layer using the SQL endpoint. This aligns with the requirement that they only have read access to the gold layer.\n\nHi LasAnsias. I have 2 questions please?\n1. Which lakehouse is Answer C referring to: Lakehouse1 or Lakehouse2?\n2. The case study overview says \"The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers.\" If we share the lakehouse with the DataAnalysts group will this not give the data analysts access to the data in the bronze and silver layers? \n\nThank you\n\nAnswer is C",
