High concurrency mode allows multiple notebooks to share the same Spark session, facilitating collaboration and efficient resource usage.\n\nHigh Concurrency Mode allows multiple notebooks to share a single Apache Spark session, improving performance, reducing costs, and speeding up execution.\n\nTo allow multiple notebooks (e.g., Notebook1 and Notebook2) in Microsoft Fabric to share the same Apache Spark session, you must enable high concurrency mode. This mode allows for concurrent execution of commands in shared sessions — ideal for collaborative or parallel workloads.\n\nEnabling high concurrency\n\nEnabling high concurrency gives opportunity for two notebooks work in the same session\n\nHigh concurrency allows multiple notebooks in same Spark session\n\nEnabling high concurrency\n\nHigh concurrency Will amake the work\n\nA is correct because without high concurrency multiple notebook can not use same spark session\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/configure-high-concurrency-session-notebooks\n\nIn Azure Fabric, when you want to share the same Apache Spark session across multiple notebooks, enabling high concurrency mode is essential.
