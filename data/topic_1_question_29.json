It is location.\n\nLooking at Fabric, the answer is Location = Workspace\n\nUbicación. Confirmado!\n\nLocation\n\n🔍 Explanation:\nIn Microsoft Fabric's Monitoring Hub, when you're tracking execution details (e.g., pipelines, notebooks, dataflows), each execution is associated with a Capacity — and each Fabric Capacity is linked to a specific workspace.\nThe Capacity column in the Monitoring Hub reflects the name of the workspace where the item ran, because each workspace operates under a specific capacity, and the Monitoring Hub shows this to help distinguish execution sources.\n\nI have gone into my Monitor in Fabric, it is Location, not Capacity. \nCapacity provides a GUID that is not unique to a Workspace.\n\nAnswer is correct\n\nLocation\n\nIn Monitoring Hub, Location = Workspace\n\nProvided answer \"Location\" is correct",
